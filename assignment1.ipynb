        "Let's start with a warmup exercise to practice our Python.  We are going to perform some basic analysis of the stock price for a fictional company NewCo.  Let's suppose we receive some data on the last 10 days of NewCo's stock price.  The data is in the form of a dictionary 'newco_dict' where the keys are ['DATE','LOW','HIGH','CLOSE'].  'DATE' contains a list of string dates. 'LOW' and 'HIGH' each contain a list of the lowest price and highest price respectively of the stock during each day in the 10-day period. 'CLOSE' contains a list of the closing price of the stock at the end of each day during the 10-day period.\n",

In part 2 we will then create a function to identify the dates on which the closing price was equal to the mode.\n",

You may assume that the dictionary is non-empty and that there is a single mode price (in real life, some datasets may have no mode, if all elements are represented equally as often, or may have more than one mode).\n",

One method (although there are others) might be to iterate through the set of the unique closing values and count how often each one appears during the 10 days.  The mode is the one that appears most frequently (has the highest count of appearances).  \n",
        "\n",
